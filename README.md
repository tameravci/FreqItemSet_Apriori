Frequent Itemsets Mining and Performance Competition (Programming)
 
Your task for this assignment is to implement and evaluate the Apriori-based algorithm for frequent itemsets mining. 
 
Implement the Apriori algorithm that is originally proposed by Agrawal et al. [AS94b] for frequent itemsets mining. You can also find the pseudocode and its related procedures from the textbook.  You are not required but encouraged to use existing or your own optimization techniques for the Apriori algorithm.  If you do, explain and discuss the techniques you have used and/or provide the appropriate references in the report. 
You can use any programming language that you are familiar with.
The program should be executable with 3 parameters: the name of the input dataset file, the threshold of minimum support count, and the name of the output file.  The minimum support count should be an integer.  An itemset is frequent if its support count is larger or equal to this threshold. 
The program should output a file that contains all the frequent itemsets together with their support.  The output file (sample output) should have the following format: each line contains a single frequent itemset as a list of items separated by whitespace.  At the end of the line, its support is printed between a pair of parenthesis.  For example: 1 2 3 (5) represents an itemset containing items 1, 2 and 3 with a support count of 5.


Result: Second best performance
